Vehicle.py – cost completely off

weight functions also in vehicle.py

BEMT.py is main run for the mission files

Sort through code, lots of excessive 

can do multiple rotors, in BEMT.py method powerReq

in method Antitorque on BEMT – do not need with even # of rotors so insert “if”

engine scaling very arbitrary

climb rate found by extra power after at endurance speed

sfc changes with power required

NEED to add a wing input after weights:

[Wing]
at certain speed, how much lift would the wing take? - will have variable from angle of attack
remove that lift from rotors

for four rotors:
	should assume to split torque evenly
	remove antitorque
	

ALWAYS ASSUME CG under rotor – may need to modify with a hinge offset input but may be hard at this level
