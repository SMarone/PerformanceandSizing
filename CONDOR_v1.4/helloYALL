**not sure if this is order but for linux these are commands I used to add new file
git pull   = updates all files and checks for new commits

git add helloYALL   = adds file to repo but doesn't commit

git commit -m "test" helloYALL  = commits change to  repo

git push origin master   = pushes changes to repo



** command i'm running for running RC heli
python CONDOR.py Config/RCHELI_Master_Input.cfg
